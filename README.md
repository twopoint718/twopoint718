### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- In my hobby spare time, Iâ€™m working on some embedded devices:
  - ðŸ¦¦ ["Otter"](https://github.com/twopoint718/pomodorov2), a bluetooth-enabled orientation-sensitive desktop task timer. The [previous version](https://github.com/twopoint718/pomodoro-timer) was a prototype completed as the final project in the [Making Embedded Systems](https://classpert.com/classpertx/courses/making-embedded-systems/cohort) online course [first cohort](https://github.com/twopoint718/RedJellies)!
  - ðŸŒˆ [Prismatic Spray](https://github.com/twopoint718/prismatic-spray) a handheld device for doing [light painting photography](https://www.google.com/?q=light%20painting%20photography). It has several RGB LEDs with adjustable color and brightness, each controlled by an ergonomic Cherry MX brown key switch. This is built around a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/).
